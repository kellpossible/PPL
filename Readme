The Plugin Patterns Library provides classes for common tasks with the XPLM SDK for the X-Plane flight simulator. It is provided under BSD license. Questions, support and pull request are handled through http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=49958 

This fork is intended to allow PPL to be used as a header-only library, following a
StackOverflow post here: http://http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25606736.

To use it in this way, put `#define LIBRARY_INLINE` before including PPL headers:

```cpp
//main.cpp
#define PRIVATENAMESPACE YourNamespaceHere
#define INLINE_LIBRARY

#include "log.h"
#include "logwriter.h"
...
```

PRIVATENAMESPACE should be a string, unique to your project. I understand this is necessary for 32-bit Windows plugins.
